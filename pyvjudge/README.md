# PyVjudge

A python client to interact with PyVjudge. This project is born to make vjudge data easily accessible to 
generate various kinds of thing such as a custom standing. As Vjudge doesn't provide apis, it would help to build 
scripts based on this online judge.

_I built it because I needed it in a project where I did combine standing from multiple contest of multiple online 
judges. Vjudge was included too._
